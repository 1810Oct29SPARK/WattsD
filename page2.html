            <h3 style="color:orangered;">Where do domestic dogs come from?</h3>
            <br />
            Well scientists have been doing loads of research into how the domestic dog came to be.

            Some studies say that the dogs we call our pets evolved from a group of wolves that came into contact with
            European hunter-gatherers between 18,800 and 32,100 years ago and may have since died out.

            After that, they identified four species of modern dogs, which are all closely related to ancient
            European mammals of the dog family, rather than wolves from China or the Middle East which shows that they
            last shared a common ancestor 18,800 years ago.

            They last shared a common ancestor with wolves around 32,100 years ago. At some point during this time they
            must have been domesticated.

            <strong style="color:orangered;">Your dog’s whiskers help him “see” in the dark.</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Okay, it’s not quite night-vision or a super power, but those whiskers pick up on even subtle changes in air currents,
            providing your pup with information about the size, shape, and speed of things nearby. This allows your dog to better sense
            approaching dangers or prey — even at night.

            <strong style="color:orangered;">Your dog does have a sense of time — and misses you when you’re gone.</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            If you think your dog knows when it’s time for dinner or a walk, you’re right! Dogs pick up on our routines and habits,
            and they also sense how much time has passed. One study showed how dogs responded differently to their owners being gone for
            different lengths of time

            <strong style="color:orangered;">On average, a dog’s mouth exerts 320 pounds of pressure.</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            The tests were done on a German shepherd, American pit bull terrier, and Rottweiler.
            In comparison, human beings exert 120 pounds, white sharks exert 600 pounds, and crocodiles exert a whopping 2,500 pounds!
            Dogs also have ten more adult teeth than humans — 42 versus 32.

            <strong style="color:orangered;">Your dog’s sense of smell is 1,000 to 10 million times better than yours.</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Depending on the breed, your dog has between 125 million to 300 million scent glands — compared to only 5 million for humans.
            And the part of your dog’s brain that controls smell is 40 times larger than yours — that’s true,
            even though the canine brain is much smaller than the human, relative to size. A human’s brain is about 1/40th of their body
            weight while a dog’s brain is only 1/125th. Don’t feel too smug, though — an ant’s brain is 1/7th its body weight.

            Your pup can pick up on subtle changes in your scent, which can help him figure out how you are feeling —
            such as by smelling your perspiration when you become nervous or fearful. It’s also likely how dogs can detect
            certain diseases or know that a household member is pregnant
